## Steps Covered in the Video üé• 

1. Download NerdFonts
    - Visit the [NerdFonts downloads page](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).
    - Select the font package that suits your needs and download it or use a script to do so

2. Extract and Install NerdFonts on Your System
For all the installation methods see the [NerdFonts repo Readme](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts?tab=readme-ov-file#font-installation)
    - For Windows:
        - Extract the fonts from the archive
        - Select all the fonts files that you want to install (you can install the entire font family)
        - Right click on the files to open the context menu, and select the install option
    - For Linux
        - Extract the fonts from the archive
        - Copy the extracted fonts in `~/.local/share/fonts`
        - run the font cache command `sudo fc-cache -fv`
    - For MacOS
        - Extract the fonts from the archive
        - Copy the extracted fonts in `~/Library/Fonts`
    - For Any OS with powershell installed:
        - Open a powershell and run the interactive installer: `& ([scriptblock]::Create((iwr 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpawlowski/nerd-fonts-installer-PS/main/Invoke-NerdFontInstaller.ps1')))`
        - More info about this script on [this repository](https://github.com/jpawlowski/nerd-fonts-installer-PS)

3. Example: Configure NerdFonts in VS Code
    - Open Visual Studio Code.
    - Go to `File > Preferences > Settings`.
    - Search for "Font Family" settings and add your installed NerdFont like this "FontName NFM" (e.g., CaskaydiaCove NFM).
        - If you have multiple fonts families in VS Code, place your preferred one first. This way VS code will use it and leave the others as fallback fonts.
