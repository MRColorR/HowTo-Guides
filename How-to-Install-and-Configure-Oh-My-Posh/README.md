2. Configuration:
    - Font Installation:
        - It's recommended to install a font that supports glyphs for a complete experience. 
        - Nerd Fonts are a popular option. You can follow the guide in this repository to install Nerd Fonts.
    - Shell Profile Configuration:
        - Open your shell's profile file (e.g., `.bashrc` for Bash on Linux/WSL or `.profile` for Windows PowerShell).
        - If the profile doesn't exist, you can create a new one.
        - Add the following line to your shell profile to initialize Oh My Posh:
            - For Bash: `eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash)"`
            - For PowerShell: `oh-my-posh init pwsh | Invoke-Expression`
            - For Zsh: `if [ "$TERM_PROGRAM" != "Apple_Terminal" ]; then eval "$(oh-my-posh init zsh)"; fi`
            - For any other shell refer to the [Oh My Posh prompt docs](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/prompt)
        - Save the file and reload your shell for the changes to take effect.

3. Change template (Optional):
    - You can explore and select a theme from the many available Oh My Posh themes.
    - Themes can display additional information like battery status, Git branch, and more.
    - To use a specific theme, add the following line to your profile, replacing <theme-name> with your desired theme: 
        - For Bash change the line to: `eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash --config ~/<theme-name>.omp.json)"`
        - For PowerShell change the line to: `oh-my-posh init pwsh --config ~/<theme-name>.omp.json | Invoke-Expression`
        - For Zsh change the line to: `eval "$(oh-my-posh init zsh --config ~/<theme-name>.omp.json)"`
        - For any other shell refer to the [Oh My Posh customization docs](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/customize)

4. Customize by Adding Segments (Optional):
    - Oh My Posh themes are built from segments, which are reusable components displaying specific information.
    - You can find a list of available segments on the Oh My Posh website.
    - To add a segment to your theme, copy the corresponding JSON code and paste it into the desired location in your theme's JSON file.
