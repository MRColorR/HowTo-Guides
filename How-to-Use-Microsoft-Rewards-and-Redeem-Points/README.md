   Now that you're signed up, let's set up your browsing environment to earn points effortlessly. We'll cover both desktop and mobile setup to maximize your earning potential.

   **Why Choose Microsoft Edge?**

   - All your favorite Chrome extensions work perfectly on Edge
   - It has built-in features for Microsoft Rewards
   - It integrates seamlessly with the Microsoft ecosystem
   - You'll earn points automatically without extra steps
   - The new Edge is completely redesigned and based on the chromium engine, just like Chrome - forget what you knew about the old version!

   **Desktop Setup Guide:**

   1. **Installing Edge:**

      - Visit [microsoft.com/edge](https://microsoft.com/edge)
      - Download and run the installer
      - Follow the setup wizard
      - When prompted, you can optionally import your bookmarks and settings

   2. **Setting Up Your Profile:**

   1. Visit Bing.com and sign in
   2. Install in chrome just the Bing Search extension, you can use it to complete daily sets without even chnaging your default search engine
   3. If you want to go further, set Bing as your default search engine in Chrome and make sure your Microsoft account is signed in
   4. Bookmark the Rewards dashboard to easily access it

   **Mobile Setup (i suggest you to Not Skip This!):**
   Your phone is a powerful point-earning tool and can help you earn extra points on the go. Here's how to set it up:
