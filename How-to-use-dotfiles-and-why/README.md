## Scripts üõ†Ô∏è

### Setup Script for installing a specific Python 3 release and its Virtual Environment
In this example we'll add to the dotfiles repository inside the script/setup folder a bash script to install python 3.9 ans its venv:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Python 3.9 and venv
sudo apt install -y python3.9 python3.9-venv

# Create a virtual environment for Python 3.9
python3.9 -m venv ~/python39_venv

echo "Python 3.9 and virtual environment setup complete!"

```
